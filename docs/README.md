Asynkio
=======
**Write IO/ Network calls painlessly.**

What I mean is..

[](_media/index_page.kt ':include :type=code kotlin')

Yes, that's it. No livedata.md. No Volley. Java/Kotlin are very bad at handling the http requests, but still `Asynkio` is the optimal way. No extra overhead, Seriously...No bullshit!

Another example

[](_media/index_page_2.kt ':include :type=code kotlin')
